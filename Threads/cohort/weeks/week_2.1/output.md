Bank Authentication vs Blockchain Authentication: Traditional banks use username/password, while blockchain relies on public-private key pairs. Banks verify credentials centrally, whereas blockchain users sign transactions with their private key for decentralized verification.

Public-Private Key Pair Usage: When creating a blockchain account, users generate a key pair. The private key is kept secret and used to sign transactions, while the public key/address is shared for receiving funds. This system ensures secure and verifiable transactions.

Hashing Process: Hashing transforms input data into a fixed-size output. The same input always produces the same hash, while different inputs yield different hashes. This property is used to verify data integrity and store passwords securely.

Encryption Process: Encryption secures data by converting it into an unreadable format. Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses separate public and private keys for enhanced security.

Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption: Symmetric encryption is like a shared diary key - fast but risky if the key is compromised. Asymmetric encryption is like a mailbox - anyone can deposit (encrypt) with the public key, but only the owner can retrieve (decrypt) with the private key.

Hashing vs Encryption: Hashing is a one-way process, ideal for password storage and data integrity checks. Encryption is reversible, used for secure communication. Hashing verifies data hasn't changed, while encryption protects data from unauthorized access.

Real-world Applications: Blockchain uses public-private key pairs for secure transactions. Password storage systems use hashing to protect user credentials. Secure messaging apps employ encryption to ensure private communication between users.

Security Implications: Understanding these concepts is crucial for developers to build secure systems. Proper key management, choosing the right cryptographic techniques, and implementing them correctly are essential for protecting user data and transactions.
