{Hey}  

Saw your post about the {Fullstack/AI} developer role at {your company}, and I would like to apply! 
I think my background in fullstack dev and AI could be a great fit.

Here are a couple of projects I’ve worked on recently:  
1. Code Wizard (LangChain Documentation Chatbot) https://github.com/RutamBhagat/Code-Wizard-LangGraph-C_RAG  
2. TalkSpark (AI-powered Conversation Starter) https://github.com/RutamBhagat/talk_spark_langgraph

I’ve been working with Python, TypeScript, LangChain, LangGraph, LCEL, Next.js, React, FastAPI, and OpenAI. I really like:  
- Building AI solutions using LangChain and LLMs  
- Developing scalable fullstack apps with Next.js + FastAPI  
- Optimizing AI model performance and creating great user experiences  

You can also check out my GitHub https://github.com/RutamBhagat and blog https://dev.to/rutamstwt to get a sense of what I’ve been up to.

Would love to chat more about how I can contribute to the team!  

Best,  
Rutam
