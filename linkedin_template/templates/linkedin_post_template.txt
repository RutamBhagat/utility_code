{Hey}  
Saw your post about the {Fullstack/AI} developer role at {your company}, and I would like to apply! 
I think my background in fullstack dev and AI could be a great fit.

Portfolio: https://rutambhagat.me

Here are a couple of projects I've worked on recently:
1. AutoExtract: Invoice Manager (Extract Structured Data from Documents) https://github.com/RutamBhagat/swipe-assignment
2. Code Wizard (LangChain Documentation Chatbot) https://github.com/RutamBhagat/Code-Wizard-LangGraph-C_RAG  
3. TalkSpark (AI-powered Conversation Starter) https://github.com/RutamBhagat/talk_spark_langgraph
4. BrochureCraft (AI-website Summarizer) https://github.com/RutamBhagat/website_summarizer

I've been working with Python, TypeScript, LangChain, LangGraph, LCEL, Next.js, React, FastAPI, and OpenAI. I really like:  
- Building AI solutions using LangChain and LLMs  
- Developing scalable fullstack apps with Next.js + FastAPI  
- Optimizing AI model performance and creating great user experiences  

If you're looking for different skills or experience, I'd love to know what you typically look for in candidates - always eager to learn and grow!

You can check out my GitHub https://github.com/RutamBhagat and blog https://dev.to/rutamstwt to get a sense of what I've been up to.
Would love to chat more about how I can contribute to the team!
