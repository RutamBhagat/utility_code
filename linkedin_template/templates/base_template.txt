{Hey}
I would like to apply for any available {Fullstack/AI} developer role at {your company}. I'd love to explore how my AI and fullstack experience could add value to your team.

Portfolio: https://rutambhagat.me

Relevant projects:
1. AutoExtract: Invoice Manager (Extract Structured Data from Documents) https://github.com/RutamBhagat/swipe-assignment
2. Code Wizard (LangChain Documentation Chatbot) https://github.com/RutamBhagat/Code-Wizard-LangGraph-C_RAG  

I've been working with Python, TypeScript, LangChain, LangGraph, LCEL, Next.js, React, FastAPI, and OpenAI. 

I really like:  
- Building AI solutions using LangChain and LLMs  
- Developing scalable fullstack apps with Next.js + FastAPI  
- Optimizing AI model performance and creating great user experiences  

If you're looking for different skills or experience, I'd love to know what you typically look for in candidates - always eager to learn and grow!
