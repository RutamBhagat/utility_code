I have been contributing to an open source project Firecrawl which is a y-combinator backed company from s22 batch. 
This project helps AI apps to get clean data from any website. It features advanced scraping, crawling, and data extraction capability.

Relevant projects:
1. AutoExtract: Invoice Manager (Extract Structured Data from Documents) https://github.com/RutamBhagat/swipe-assignment
2. Code Wizard (LangChain Documentation Chatbot) https://github.com/RutamBhagat/Code-Wizard-LangGraph-C_RAG  

I've been working with Python, TypeScript, LangChain, LangGraph, Next.js, FastAPI 

I really like:  
- Building AI solutions using LangChain and LLMs  
- Developing scalable fullstack apps with Next.js + FastAPI  
- Optimizing AI model performance and creating great user experiences  

If you're looking for different skills or experience, I'd love to know what you typically look for in candidates - always eager to learn and grow!
