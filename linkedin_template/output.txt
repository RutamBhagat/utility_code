Hey Albert  
Saw your post about the Frontend developer role at VectorShift, and I would like to apply! 
I think my background in fullstack dev and AI could be a great fit.

Portfolio: https://rutambhagat.me

Relevant projects:
1. AutoExtract: Invoice Manager (Extract Structured Data from Documents) https://github.com/RutamBhagat/swipe-assignment
2. Code Wizard (LangChain Documentation Chatbot) https://github.com/RutamBhagat/Code-Wizard-LangGraph-C_RAG  

I've been working with Python, TypeScript, LangChain, LangGraph, Next.js, FastAPI

I really like:  
- Building AI solutions using LangChain and LLMs  
- Developing scalable fullstack apps with Next.js + FastAPI  
- Optimizing AI model performance and creating great user experiences  

If you're looking for different skills or experience, I'd love to know what you typically look for in candidates - always eager to learn and grow!
